Once upon a time, this 1957 mid-century ranch home was a futuristic creation of architect G. N. Richards. ''The house with the famous curved wall'' retains all its original character with a generous atomic boost from a local vintage enthusiast @uniquelyrochelles. Styled to the nines, this house is the epitome of retro cool. Not much has changed since 1957, except the drab, vanilla moments of later year remodels have been left in the dust and the home has been lovingly brought into Technicolor. As featured in Daily Mail, Hooked On The Look, Right This Minute, Mirror and Fox 10. This home was also booked out consistently as a destination set for video and photo shoots. Come on in to see why!  As you arrive, you'll feel the time warp pull you back to the 1950s. If you adore vintage style, it will be guaranteed love at first sight. The kitschy curb appeal is straight out of a Hollywood movie. With sprawling luxury turf and towering palm trees, this home is always picture-perfect (and low-maintenance!). The most perfect minty green exterior is dressed up with 'jewelry' including Barbie pink script house letters by Tim's Custom Creations, retro Modbox USA curbside mailbox, round stepping stone path and pink chimney painted to match the epic sunsets. The 2 car carport showcases one of the home's 'famous' curved walls and a decorative window that frames the mountain views.

Every detail of this home was curated and designed to bring the 1950s back to life. There are 2 'famous' curved block walls in the home. Original upgrades from the builder, James G. Hart, include a built-in curved wall entry planter (super rare!) and fireplace. The living room is the epitome of style with period-appropriate finishes including two-tone paint, vintage reproduction 'haze"" patterned vinyl flooring, skylight, display shelving around the ceiling and gas fireplace with bench seat and custom starburst gas key. The formal dining room opens to the living room and offers full-height banquet windows with custom shutters and a vintage pull-down flying saucer pendant light. The 'tiki room' will transport you to a tropical oasis with bamboo finished walls and ceilings, along with a working faux rain window (ala Disney's Tiki Room).

The retro triangular kitchen is a perfect pink delight with restored finishes and amazing period reproduction features. It has been renovated to look just like it would have in 1957! Vintage details include the original cabinetry updated in a lovely shade of petal pink with one-of-a-kind circular pulls. The owners gutted a portion of the kitchen that wasn't period-appropriate and installed a 1950s pink GE wall oven and push button GE electric cooktop with Nu-Tone vent hood. New, yet vintage-looking, amenities include the custom pink Samsung dishwasher (painted at an auto body shop to match the pink kitchen!), Kohler stainless steel deep basin sink, Dishmaster Imperial Four sink faucet dishwashing system, patterned vinyl floors and Wilsonart aqua ripple counters.

Welcome to pure glam in the primary suite with an entire mirrored wall of closets and reproduction patterned vinyl flooring. The primary bath is a perfect 1957 time-capsule with petal pink original cabinetry complete with beauty vanity area with pull-out hamper, original sink, Hollywood lights and tiled tub/shower. As if a vintage Barbie theme wasn't enough, there are 2 secondary bedrooms that are Disney themed. A Disney/Mickey Mouse room features a custom chair rail, Mickey Mouse wallpaper and an antique bank door from the 1800s finished to create Walt Disney's office! There is another bedroom styled with Disney flair of the Hollywood Tower Hotel and the Haunted Mansion with concrete floors, crown moulding and ornate ceiling tiles. Don't miss the hall bathroom which features the original yellow tiled shower, petal pink cabinetry, pedestal sink, black and white checkerboard flooring and separate beauty vanity with tiled counter, vintage ball pendant and lighted mirror.

This home is situated on an incredibly unique lot with mountain views to the North and East, along with direct access to the Arizona Cÿanal Trail (no neighbors directly behind). Barbie's backyard is flirty and fun! If you enjoy sunsets and mountain views, make your way up the spiral staircase to the rooftop deck, where you will be greeted with a Barbie pink deck floor and panoramic mountain views to Piestewa Peak, Phoenix Mountains Preserve and North Mountain. An expansive rear covered patio painted Barbie Pink extends into the yard leading to a small in-ground water feature/pond. Wrought iron gates lead to the canal path, where you can explore 39 miles of walking/biking path. There is ample storage opportunities including lockable storage closets in the carport, a large storage shed with electric service, storage closets off the back patio and another storage shed.

The neighborhood is very walkable/bikeable and within 1 mile you will find local favorites: Luci's at the Orchard, Veggie Village, Dilla Libre, Kaleidoscope Juice, Berry Berry Best Acai Bowls, Starbucks, Safeway and Palma Park. Just under 2 miles, you'll enjoy Sprouts, Let It Roll bowling, Little Miss BBQ, Timo Wine Bar, North Mountain Brewing Company, Aunt Chiladas, Tutti Santi, Dutch Bros and Los Taquitos. Home is located in the sought-after Sunnyslope High School District. Future residents will soon be able to walk/bike on the Arizona Canal Trail, to the new OHSO Brewery and Little O's neighborhood restaurant and marketplace at Central and Butler (coming soon!).

This home was one of the first 6 homes built in the subdivision in 1957. The El Domingo Ranchos subdivision has 47 mid-century ranch homes with famous curved walls and is incredibly low-turnover. Don't miss this rare opportunity to own a piece of iconic architecture with all the vintage Barbie vibes!"
